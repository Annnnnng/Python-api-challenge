# Python-api-challenge
This API homework is a combination of python, pandas, plotting and api key skills. 
Part 1 is about the weather api key. A good practise using api key to call the server to locate the cities given and grab their weather information, such as temperature, humidity, cloudiness, etc. Loop through the api response to export weather information into dataframe for futher analysis.
By plotting temperature, humidity, cloudiness and some other weather factor based on latitude, the relationships between the factors and latitude can be observed. The temperature gets the higest point around 20Â° N and gets lower at its south and north. The cloudiness and windspeed has no relation to latitue. 
Liner regression is used to analyze weather differences in southern and northen hemisphere, an outstanding result is that the temperature has a negative relationship to latitude in northern hemisphere while in southern hemisphere, it is a negative relationship between latitude and temperature.
Part 2 is about the google api and jupyter gmaps. To practise how to display google maps within data and to add layers and markers on the map. A good practice to get to know google api and gmaps.
